## SMART INDIA HACKATHON 2022 PROJECT
### REFER TO THE PDF IN THE REPOSITORY FOR FULL DETAILS ABOUT THE PROJECT

SAHARA is a project aimed at improving the mobility and safety of visually impaired individuals by creating a smart cane with advanced features. Traditional white canes have limitations in detecting obstacles and providing early warnings to users. SAHARA addresses these challenges by incorporating cutting-edge technology into a cane to enhance its functionality.

## Problem Statement

Visually impaired individuals often face difficulties in tracking obstacles and harmful objects in their surroundings using traditional white canes. The range of detection is limited and depends on the length of the cane. To overcome these limitations and provide a safer and more efficient solution, we have developed SAHARA.

## Features

### 1. Obstacle Detection

SAHARA's primary feature is its ability to detect obstacles and objects even from a distance of 1 to 3 meters. This advanced detection system enhances the user's awareness of their surroundings, significantly improving safety and mobility.

### 2. SOS Button

The cane is equipped with an SOS button, allowing the user to send an emergency message to their family or caregivers. When activated, SAHARA sends a warning message along with the user's real-time location, ensuring a quick response in critical situations.

### 3. Vibration Sensor

To prevent theft or unauthorized use of the cane, SAHARA includes a vibration sensor. Users can activate this sensor when needed, and it will provide alerts if someone attempts to steal the cane.

### 4. Face Detection

SAHARA incorporates a face detection feature, enabling users to identify family members and known individuals. This feature enhances social interactions by helping users recognize the people they are conversing with.

### 5. Accessibility and Affordability

Our mission is to make SAHARA an accessible and affordable solution for visually impaired individuals worldwide. We aim to reach those in need by designing this advanced cane in a cost-effective manner.
